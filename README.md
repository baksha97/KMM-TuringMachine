- What is the purpose of your app?
The purpose of this application is to simulate a Turing machine. A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. This application provides a visual simulation of the manipulation of said "strip of tape." You are able to create machines with 1) the initial input of numbers and 2) the set of commands (known as quadruples) which the machine will follow and execute.
