- What is the purpose of your app?
  
  The purpose of this application is to simulate a Turing machine. 

  A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. This application provides a visual simulation of the manipulation of said "strip of tape." 

  In this app, you can create machines with 1) the initial input of numbers and 2) the set of commands (known as quadruples) which the "machine" will follow and execute. 

  If you would like more information (or examples of programs), please take a look at the information button on the top navigation bar. 

- Who are the target audiences?

  The target audience of this application students/hobbists studying the Theory of Computation.

- What are the primary feature/functionality of your app?

  The primary function of this application (currently) is to create and save various configurations of Turing Machines. This application may later be extended to simulate other various machines/languages within the automata theory.
