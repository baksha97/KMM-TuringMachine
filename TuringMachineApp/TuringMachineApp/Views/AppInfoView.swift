To create a new machine, you can click the create button on the My Machines page.
When creating a new machine, there are some limitations in place:
You can only set 5 initial numbers on tape. Each number can range a maximum of 12.
We do not have infinite tape on the device, so we are currently limited to 5000 cells of tape (including input).

Program input ignores/works around:
Empty lines (space out your work)
Lines containing "//" (comment or take out a line instead of deleting it)
Trailing/Leading white-space (so you don't have to worry about checking for white-space).
The quadruple states are treated as Strings; you do not need to use numbers for the states & you may append letters to numbers to make a valid state, for example: 1m,1,L,1c
